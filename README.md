# Kilroy

############### Overview

Kilroy is a Mod Manager for Stellaris and Europa Universalis IV.  It is designed around the new Luancher that Paradox has, um, 'graced' us with for these two games.

Documentation is in the "DOC" Folder and contains a Full User Manaul and screenshot diagram of the layout of Kilroy.  As Kilroy was designed using Advanced Windows Forms based Technology and 1993 Design Aesthetics, you should probably give this a look over as Kilroy has Many Buttons.

The actual Release File(s) are in "_Release" and consist of the Kilroy.exe file.  Just download this file, drop it in your Documents/Stellaris or Documents/Europa Universalis IV folder and run it, and it should populate the list on the right with your mods.  If it doesn't, or it crashes, then see the next section.

############### Error Reporting

If you encounter errors, please report them.  I have a dbinbox folder available at the location below that you can use to upload files.  When you upload files, please zip the files into an archive which includes the name you intend to post your bug report under so It is easy for me to identify who sent me the files.
